# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.10.0-qtim.1] - 2026-09-15

qtim fork of [aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp) 0.10.0.

### Features
- **`issue_get_attachment_content`** — downloads an attachment by id (ids come from `issue_get_attachments`). png/jpeg/gif/webp up to 5 MB are returned inline as an image (`ImageContent`), so the model sees the picture in the tool result; anything else is written to `<tmp>/yandex-tracker-mcp/<issue>-<id>-<name>` and the path is returned. Upstream only lists attachment metadata
  - `issue_download_attachment` on the issues protocol, the custom client (through the shared `_read`) and the caching client (passthrough, never cached)
- **Claude Code plugin** — the repository installs as a plugin marketplace: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (`qtim-yandex-tracker`), `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with `userConfig` (`tracker_token` is `sensitive` and lands in the OS keychain, `tracker_cloud_org_id` / `tracker_org_id` in `settings.json`), `.mcp.json` that starts the server with `uv run --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and passes `${user_config.*}` as `TRACKER_*` env

### Documentation
- README rewritten for the fork (Russian): install as a Claude Code plugin, the `configure` fields, what the fork adds, plugin layout, syncing with upstream, running via `uvx --from git+…`. The upstream README/README_ru are linked instead of being carried along; `README_ru.md` removed

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-06

### Features

- **Queue component tools** — `queue_get_components`, `component_get`, `component_create`, `component_update`, `component_delete` ([#30](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/pull/30))
- **Checklist write tools for issues** — `issue_add_checklist_items`, `issue_update_checklist_item`, `issue_delete_checklist_item`; checklists were read-only ([#44](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/issues/44))

### Documentation

- **`rules/`** — guidelines for tool naming, tool and parameter descriptions and the documentation, with the tests that enforce them
- Both READMEs list the tools as one table per category instead of restating the JSON schema argument by argument
- Tool descriptions are shorter and name the Russian term for what they act on, so a Russian prompt reaches the right tool

### Internal

- **Python 3.14** is in the CI test matrix
- Update `pydantic`, `cryptography` and `yandexcloud` dependencies to latest versions

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-27

### Features

- **Agile board and sprint tools**, read-only ([#42](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/issues/42))
  - `boards_get_all` finds the board, `board_get` reads its settings, `board_get_columns` the columns with the issue statuses mapped onto each of them, and `board_get_sprints` the sprints — take the one with `status == "in_progress"` and pass its id to `issue_create` / `issue_update`. Sprints could already be set on write, but nothing could discover a sprint id
- An issue's **`boards`** is a typed field now. Tracker always returned it, but unmodelled: `extra="allow"` leaked it into answers while `outputSchema` never mentioned it and `fields` could not select it. The board id an issue names now feeds straight into the board tools
- **`TrackerAPITimeout`** — a request that runs out of its budget says which request timed out after how long and that `TRACKER_API_TIMEOUT` raises it, instead of surfacing as `Error executing tool <name>:` with nothing after the colon (`str(TimeoutError())` is the empty string). Every Tracker request answers a timeout this way, the boards listing it was written for included

### Bug Fixes

- **The queue allow-lists match ignoring case.** `TRACKER_LIMIT_QUEUES` / `TRACKER_READ_ONLY_QUEUES` were compared to the queue key exactly, and nothing upper-cased either side: Tracker's keys are upper-case, the variables are written by hand. A mis-cased entry did not fail, it quietly meant something else — `TRACKER_LIMIT_QUEUES=dev` locked out `DEV-1` along with every other queue, and `TRACKER_READ_ONLY_QUEUES=dev` left `DEV` writable while the configuration read as if it were protected
  - Both variables are normalised once on load into a set of upper-cased keys (`decode_queue_keys`), so a check is one hash lookup rather than a pass over the list per row; entries differing only in case collapse, and a list, set or tuple passed programmatically is normalised the same way
- With `TOOLS_CACHE_ENABLED=true`, the caller's raw OAuth/IAM token no longer ends up in the Redis cache key. aiocache builds keys by stringifying the cached method's arguments, so `YandexAuth`'s repr wrote the token verbatim into a namespace visible to `KEYS`/`SCAN`/`MONITOR`, RDB dumps and per-key metrics; secret fields now render as a SHA-256 fingerprint, which keeps entries distinct per caller and stops the token leaking into logs and tracebacks too
  - Cache entries written by earlier versions become misses and expire by TTL

### Documentation

- The server instructions described a read-only server: they listed only browsing and querying, though 14 write tools had landed since, and said nothing about the traps an agent walks into first. They now cover that writing exists, that `version` goes stale on its own because triggers and automation bump it right after `issue_create`, that no write tool takes a template id (read the template and pass its values), that `summonees` is what notifies a user where a plain `@login` notifies nobody, that `fields` keeps a large listing out of the context window, and that a missing write tool or a rejected queue may be this server's configuration rather than missing data
- `tests/mcp/server/test_instructions.py` fails if the instructions name a tool that is not registered or promise an argument a tool does not take, which is what let this drift unnoticed
- The README examples could not work as printed: every client configuration set `TRACKER_CLOUD_ORG_ID` and `TRACKER_ORG_ID` at once, which makes every call raise "Only one of org_id or cloud_org_id should be provided.", and the Docker examples published port 8000 without `TRANSPORT`, so the container came up on the stdio default and listened on nothing. The English README also called the entity tools read-only, and both pointed at tool names this server has never had (`get_queue_metadata`, `queue_get_local_fields`)
- The tool descriptions, the server instructions and the two READMEs are shorter. The board, template and project/portfolio/goal entries had grown into essays on how the tools work inside - why the board listing is walked page by page, which call answers 500 on a partial checklist. What a caller acts on stays (arguments, what comes back, the traps); the rationale belongs in the code and the commit history

### Internal

- Every client request goes through one `_request()` context manager: auth headers, timeout translation, `_raise_for_status` and the 404/409 → domain error mapping were sixty copies of the same lines, and had drifted

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-19

### Features

- **Project, portfolio and goal tools** — the entities API, distinct from queues and issues ([#45](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/pull/45))
  - 39 tools: get/find, create/update/delete with optimistic concurrency via `version`, comments, and checklists (projects and portfolios only — the API has none for goals)
  - Reads take a per-entity `fields` selector defaulting to a small base set, so `metricItems` and a goal's `progressPercentage` / `keyResultItems` must be asked for explicitly
  - Off by default behind `TRACKER_ENTITIES_ENABLED`: they double the tool manifest (43 tools to 82) and are not covered by `TRACKER_LIMIT_QUEUES` / `TRACKER_READ_ONLY_QUEUES`, since an entity has no single queue. `TRACKER_READ_ONLY` still unregisters the write tools
  - `links` are added, never replaced, and are write-only in Tracker: an existing link cannot be re-sent, read back, or removed through this server. A links-only update is rejected rather than reported as a success Tracker silently ignores
  - `*_update_checklist` edits existing items by id; items you don't mention, and fields left unset on ones you do, are left as-is
- **Issue and comment template tools**, read-only ([#43](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/issues/43), [#48](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/pull/48))
  - `issue_templates_get_all` / `issue_template_get`, `comment_templates_get_all` / `comment_template_get`
  - The issue body a template prefills is in `fieldTemplates.description`, not the template's own `description`
  - Optional `queue` scoping, every page retrieved by default, `TRACKER_LIMIT_QUEUES` enforced
- **`TRACKER_READ_ONLY_QUEUES`** — per-queue read-only access, so one instance can be read-write on some queues and read-only on others ([#36](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/issues/36))
- **`TRACKER_API_TIMEOUT`** (default `10`) — the per-request Tracker timeout was hardcoded and could not be raised
- **Paginated listings report their totals.** `issues_find`, `users_get_all`, `queues_get_all` and both template listings answer with `{values, hits, pages}`, built from the `X-Total-Count` / `X-Total-Pages` headers the client used to discard. The last page no longer has to be found by requesting the empty one after it
  - Totals are withheld where they would mislead: on a full walk, and when `TRACKER_LIMIT_QUEUES` hides rows Tracker counted
- **`issues_find` selects fields through the API** (`_search?fields=`), so unwanted fields are never fetched instead of fetched and dropped
  - `fields` now takes any field name, not just the 25 `Issue` declares: `resolution`, `queue`, `project`, `followers`, queue-local and organization-custom fields become selectable. Pass the field `id` from `queue_get_fields`; both `story_points` and `storyPoints` work
- `issue_create` gained the typed reference parameters `issue_update` already had (`parent`, `sprint`, `followers`, `components`, `tags`, `project`, `markup_type`), and `issue_update` gained `assignee` and `components`
- A `fields` map on `issue_create` / `issue_update` overrides the dedicated parameter of the same name, which is how a field is cleared: `{"assignee": null}` clears it
- `get_priorities` returns each priority's `id` and `description`

### Breaking Changes

- Responses use Tracker's own field names instead of the Python ones: `storyPoints`, `createdAt`, `updatedBy`, `textHtml` and the rest. A response can now be fed straight back into a `fields` map; callers reading `story_points` or `created_at` need updating
- `issues_find`, `users_get_all`, `queues_get_all`, `issue_templates_get_all` and `comment_templates_get_all` return `{values, hits, pages}` instead of a bare list — iterate `values`
- `issues_count` returns `{"count": N}` instead of a bare integer, which for a project of 403 issues was indistinguishable from an HTTP 403
- `issue_get_comments` returns the cursor-paginated `{comments, next_cursor}` instead of a list, and without pagination arguments returns the first 50 comments rather than all of them

### Bug Fixes

- `fields` actually filters the response instead of blanking it, in every tool that offers the selector. Asking `issues_find` for `["key"]` used to return a dozen null keys per issue
  - Undeclared fields the API returns (`self`, `id`, `queue`, a queue's `<queue-id>--<key>` local fields) sat in the model's extras, which carry no `exclude_if`, so blanking left them as explicit nulls; they are now dropped
  - `User`, `IssueComment`, `Worklog` and `IssueAttachment` declared optionals with a bare `Field(None)` and leaked nulls the same way. A test now fails if a model reachable from a `fields` selector forgets `exclude_if`
- `issue_create` no longer answers 422 for `components: ["694"]` or `followers: ["8000000000000034"]`: reference values are typed models shared with `issue_update`, with `IssueComponentRef` requiring exactly one of `id` / `name` because Tracker reads a bare string there as a component *name*
- A key in `fields` naming a dedicated parameter no longer fails with `TypeError: got multiple values for keyword argument 'parent'`
- `assignee` and `parent` can be cleared at all — `null` was unreachable and `""` answered 422
- An empty reference object (`type={}`) is refused locally with a readable message instead of an unhelpful 400/422
- API errors carry Tracker's own `errorMessages` / `errors` instead of a bare "Unprocessable Entity"
- A 409 on update raises `IssueVersionConflict`, which explains that queue triggers bump the version right after creation, so the version from `issue_create` must not be reused
- A missing queue raises `QueueNotFound` on every queue-scoped read (`queue_get_tags`, `queue_get_versions`, `queue_get_fields`, `queue_get_metadata`), not just the newest ones
- `queue_get_metadata` returns what `expand` asked for, and answers a requested but empty section with an empty list instead of omitting it
- `IssueComment` is a complete model again: `MaillistReference` was declared after the forward reference that used it, leaving the model unbuilt
- `queue_get_fields` and `get_priorities` are described as what they are, so tool search finds them and callers know `get_global_fields` holds the rest

### Internal

- Entity tool and parameter descriptions state shared rules once in the server instructions instead of repeating them per tool, cutting ~21 KB from the manifest
- Update dependencies: `aiohttp` 3.14.3 (undoing the `<3.14` cap from 0.7.2), `cryptography` 50.0.0, `mcp` 1.29.0, `pydantic-settings` 2.15.0, `yandexcloud` 0.403.0, `yarl` 1.24.5

## [0.7.3] - 2026-07-28

### Bug Fixes
- Constrain the `mcp` SDK dependency to `>=1.21,<2` ([fixes #39](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/issues/39))
  - `mcp` 2.0.0 removed `FastMCP` (renamed to `MCPServer`) and dropped the `mcp.server.fastmcp` package, so fresh `uvx`/`pip` installs failed at startup with `ImportError: cannot import name 'FastMCP' from 'mcp.server'`
  - Docker images were unaffected because they build from the pinned `uv.lock`

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-19

  - Supports `notify`, `notify_author`, `move_all_fields`, and `initial_status` flags
  - Returns the issue with its new key in the target queue
  - When the client supports elicitation, prompts the user to confirm these flags before performing the (irreversible) move; declining or cancelling aborts the move. Clients without elicitation support fall back to the passed-in values
- Add `issue_add_link` and `issue_delete_link` MCP tools to manage links between issues ([fixes #26](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/issues/26))
  - `issue_add_link` accepts a `relationship` (e.g. `relates`, `depends on`, `duplicates`) and the target issue key
  - `issue_delete_link` removes a link by its ID
- Add `queue_create_version` MCP tool to create a new version in a queue ([#29](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/pull/29))
  - Supports `name`, `description`, `start_date`, and `due_date`
- Support passthrough Bearer OAuth token authentication for reverse proxy / gateway deployments ([#23](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/pull/23), [#27](https://github.com/aikts/yandex-tracker-mcp/pull/27))
  - Reads the Yandex OAuth token from the incoming `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header when MCP OAuth middleware does not provide a token
